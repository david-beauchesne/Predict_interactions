% \\TODO: Eventually, instead of narrowing the focus to families of empirical data observed, everything available in marine and coastal ecosystems should be extracted from GloBI. This could be achieved rather easily.

% \\REVIEW: I am not convinced whether non-interactions are useful, as we are not even using them. Either we consider them in the algorithm to decrease probabilities of interactions are known to not happen, or we do not use them at all. I would tend to not use them since I am not convinced that non-interactions are valid data coming from food webs.

% \\REVIEW: I want to raise the question of the utility of non-interactions in the analyses. At this point, the algorithm is coded to ignore non-interactions in the similarity measurements. Maybe it would make sense to do the same in the interpretation of the results itself. Or a third vector to the similarity measurements could be added that considers non-interactions as a set of resources not consumed by consumers (which we have in the data). While this could make sense, more thought needs to be given to non-interactions stemming from empirical food webs and their actual value as observed data. If we think them valuable, then extra logical steps could be added to the algorithm to decrease probabilities of taxa being proposed as candidate resources by the KNN algorithm when they were observed to not interact in food webs.

% \\TODO: taxonomic similarity measure instead of tanimoto similarity

% \\IDEA: In an ideal world, another completely independant food web that was not used in the catalogue. Check stomach content data for St. Lawrence fish from IML, Denis Chabot. Claude Nozères is doing lab work on this, alternatively discuss with him first.

% \\REVIEW: Minimum threshold value to test and discuss. Completely arbitrary at this point.

% \\IDEA: Another interesting thought from this is the potential use of GloBI on its own to perform automated and quick analyses. If non-interactions are deemed unecessary or of dubious quality, focusing only on observed interactions could lead to the creation of a platform on which interactions in a given system could be easily predicted from GloBI alone, or almost. GloBI interactions data already holds taxonomic classification. It's quality is however unfortunately not uniform and care must be taken when it is used. In any case, if only interactions (1) are considered, then a third party platform could be built that uses the algorithm built in this paper, the GloBI data and a list of species for which we wish to predict the interactions.

% \\IDEA: Add a simple working example of a food web.

% \\TODO: verify 94 food webs

Large networks of ecological interactions, such as food webs, are complex to characterize, be it empirically or theoretically. The former requires exhaustive observations, while the latter generally requires ample data to be validated. Although large empirical datasets describing pairwise consumer-resource interactions are increasingly available, full descriptions of entire ecosystems are still few and far between. We therefore wondered whether available data, albeit originating from different ecosystems, could be used to predict species interactions in data deficient ecosystems. To test this, we built a biotic interaction catalogue from a collection of \textit{94} empirical food webs, detailed predator-prey interaction databases and interactions from the Global Biotic Interaction (GloBI) database. We use an unsupervised machine learning method to predict interactions between any given set of taxa, given pairwise taxonomic proximity and known consumer and resource sets found in the interaction catalogue. Initial results suggest that pairwise interactions can be predicted with high accuracy. Although results are seemingly dependent on the comprehensiveness of the catalogue rather than the taxonomic similarity between taxa, taxonomy was found to complement well the catalogue and to allow the algorithm to perform well when the amount of information available through the catalogue decreased. Given it’s high accuracy, this methodology could democratize the use of food webs and network level descriptors in remote location where empirical data is hard to gather. Network characteristics could then be efficiently evaluated and correlated to levels of environmental stressors in order to improve vulnerability assessments of ecosystems to global changes, opening promising avenues for further research and for management initiatives.

\section{Introduction}
% À venir
% Define whether I talk that much about taxonomic proximity or not. The fact is that set of consumers and resources seem to work much better, although taxonomy has to be useful in cases when there are no information on the species for which we are attempting to characterize interactions.


% Interactions are described for a limited amount of taxa in varying types of environments.
%
% Describing the structure of a community often requires a thorough understanding of species composition and interactions locally. This kind of knowledge is often lacking.
%
% Species that are taxonomically closely related are thought to have a higher probability of sharing similar types predators and preys (refs). Based on that assumption, taxonomy could be used as a proxy to predict biotic interactions between taxa.
%
% Identify species that are likely to interact in any given environment by training models with empirical data coming from other communities.
%
% based on their taxonomic or phylogenetic proximity
%
% Our objective was therefore to test whether we could predict species interactions in a given community using empirical data gathered from other communities.


% So the idea:


% 1st par.: Challenge of fully describing interactions in a community.

% Notes:
%   J'aime pas ce paragraphe, mais il donne quand même une bonne idée de ce que je veux avancer comme premier paragraphe, surtout la première et la dernière phrase. Du moins jusqu'à ce que je détruise ce que j'ai écrit pour le reformater...

To include in introduction: interactions can also be predicted by functional traits such as body size and metabolism type (e.g. Gravel et al 2013;), yet even those can be difficult to extensively characterize for multiple taxa. We therefore sought more readily available information for all taxa of interest.

We therefore turned our attention towards phylogenies, taxonomies, to get more readily available data for each taxon of interest


The study of ecosystem structure and function is increasingly focusing on communities of interacting species that form the biological backbone of ecosystems. Fully describing consumer-resource interactions can however be a daunting task due tho the sheer number of potential interactions, even for a limited number of species (Dodds and Nelson 2006). The empirical description of interactions at the community scale can thus be limited by logistical constraints (Dunne 2006; Morales-Castilla et al. 2015). In the context of environmental impact evaluation, the time required to gather empirical data can further diminish the applicability of such methodologies due to time constraints (ref).

% -----------------------------
% 2nd par.: Predicting interactions based on traits and phylogenies (See, among others, Eklof)

% Notes:
%   Find other references for first sentence, it's looks like auto-citation a lot: (e.g. Gravel et al., 2013; Albouy et al., 2014; Morales-Castilla et al., 2015).

  % 'Because of shared evolutionary history, closely related species typically have similar traits [13], which in turn determine their trophic interactions. As such, similar species are more likely to consume or be consumed by similar species [8,14,15]. Evolutionary history could possibly then be used as a surrogate for trophically important traits. Therefore, it is likely that we could detect a signature of evolutionary history in the structure of food webs where closely related species should have specific patterns of interactions (Eklof et al. 2012, citation).' ?
  % They explain it better than I do and I assume that my paragraph is much less interesting, to the point, relevant and factually correct. Plus, the second has absolutely no references to back it up, as everything essentially comes from Eklof et al 2012.

  % 'Consumers are organized in groups forming a nested hierarchy, which better reflects the complexity and multidimensionality of most natural systems' Cattin et al. 2004

Alternative approaches to predicting interactions among community members have thus been explored in order to efficiently resolve interaction webs using incomplete, imperfect or even unavailable data (e.g. Gravel et al., 2013; Morales-Castilla et al., 2015). These approaches rely on the use of proxies such as functional traits to infer interactions consumer-resource relationships (Morales-Castilla et al. 2015). Multiple traits can play a significant role in community dynamics and influence the presence and intensity of biotic interactions, like the influence of body size on predator-prey interactions, a literal take on \textit{big fish eats small fish} (Cohen et al., 2003; Brose et al., 2006; Gravel et al. 2013).

Evolutionary processes causes closely related species to share similar traits. This proximity increases the likelihood of closely related species sharing consumer and resources. Furthermore, trait differentiation arises through evolution, dictated by the coevolutionary dynamics and trait matching of consumers and resources. It is therefore likely that phylogenies could serve as proxies of important traits and, by extention, help predict pairwise interactions.

% -----------------------------
% 3rd par.: Methodologies for interaction predictions: Machine-learning algorithms. Need large datasets to 'learn from'.



% -----------------------------
% 4th par.: Preexisting data available in different environment. Can we make use of the relationship between evolutionary processes and consumer-resource trait matching to construct large datasets from which we can infer other species interactions?
These methodologies require large datasets from which models must be trained. There exist a large collection of empirical data that could be used to train such models. However, this collection comes from a wide variety of species and ecosystems.

Could we make use of such data to predict interactions in a given community in which knowledge is lacking, based on the phylogenetic proximity of species. Is it a truism to say that a species spatially distant from each other are likely to consume other species that are closely related phylogenetically?


% -----------------------------
% 5th par.: Objective and predictions


  Can we make use of existing heterogeneous data to predict interactions in a given community % Find better term than heterogeneous for this. I want to say that the data comes from many different studies, areas and types of ecosystems

The goal is to obtain a fully or optimally resolved interaction matrix for all taxa in a given community, i.e. constructing the community metaweb, or its topology (Dunne 2006).



  Consumer-resource trait matching dictate the interactions in a given community
  Trait differentiation arise through evolution, dictated by the coevolutionary dynamics of consumer-resource


  Thus, can we take advantage of available data to predict biotic interactions in data-poor environments? The objective of this paper is to use the link between taxonomic proximity and shared interactions to build models predicting biotic interactions in data poor ecosystems.

%             METHODS
% ---------------------------------
% ---------------------------------
\section{Methods}
The objective of the methods is to predict the interactions for all taxa within an arbitrary set \textit{S1} using a set of taxa \textit{S0} with empirically described interactions and their similarity measured from consumer/resource sets and their taxonomy. We couple the use of empirical data with an unsupervised machine learning method to achieve this.

 \subsection{Biotic interaction catalogue}
   % \\REVIEW: Verify 'scientific nomenclature'
   % \\TODO: Appendix 1 Description of food web used. The majority come from GlobalWeb
   % \\TODO: Add reference GlobalWeb database (http://globalwebdb.com)
   % \\TODO: Verify references to add
   % \\TODO: Add GloBI; http://www.globalbioticinteractions.org
   % \\REVIEW: Verify number of taxa and number per taxa for first data compilation step

We built a biotic interaction catalogue to serve as a set of taxa \textit{S0} with empirically described interactions. The empirical data used to construct the interaction catalogue was gathered in two successive steps. The first consisted of gathering data from a collection of 94 empirical food webs in marine and coastal ecosystems from which we extracted pairwise taxa interactions (Brose et al. 2005; Kortsch et al. 2015; GlobalWeb database; see Appendix 1 for a description of food webs). We also used a detailed predator-prey interaction database describing trophic relationships between \textit{XX} predators and their prey (Barnes et al. 2008). From these datasets, only interactions between taxa at the taxonomic scale of the family or higher were selected for inclusion in the catalogue.

As empirical food webs are vastly dominated by non-interactions, these datasets yielded a highly skewed distribution of interactions vs non-interactions. To counterbalance this, the second step of data compilation consisted of extracting observed interactions from the Global Biotic Interaction (GloBI) database (ref), which describes binary interactions for a wide range of taxa worldwide. We extracted all interactions available on GloBI for species belonging to the families of taxa identified through step 1. Interactions were extracted using the rGloBI package in R (ref). As for step 1, only interactions between taxa at the taxonomic scale of the family or higher were retained

The nomenclature used between datasets and food webs varied substantially. Taxa names thus had to be verified, modified according to the scientific nomenclature and validated. This process was performed using the Taxize package in R (ref) and manually verified for errors. The same package was used to extract the taxonomy of all taxa for which interactions were obtained in previous steps. The complete R code and data used for the catalogue is available at \href{https://github.com/david-beauchesne/Interaction_catalog}{https://github.com/david-beauchesne/Interaction\_catalog}.

  \subsection{Unsupervised machine learning}
We use the \textit{K}-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm (\textbf{ref}) to predict pairwise interactions for a set of taxa \textit{S}. The KNN algorithm predicts missing entries or proposes additional entries by a majority vote based on the \textit{K} nearest (\textit{i.e.} most similar) entries. In this case, taxa are described by a set of resources when considered as a consumer, a set of consumers when considered as a resource and their taxonomy (\textit{i.e.} kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species). Similarity between taxa was evaluated using the Tanimoto similarity measure (\textbf{ref}), which compares two vectors with \textit{i} elements based on the number of elements they share and contain:

\begin{equation}
  tanimoto(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \frac{\sum_i x_i \land y_i}{\sum_i x_i \lor y_i},
\end{equation}

where $\land$ is bitwise \emph{and}, while $\lor$ is the bitwise \emph{or} operators. Adding a weighing scheme, we can measure the similarity using two different sets of vectors with \textit{i} and \textit{j} elements, respectively.

\begin{equation}
  tanimoto_t(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, w_t) = w_ttanimoto(\mathbf{x_i}, \mathbf{y_i}) + (1 - w_t)tanimoto(\mathbf{x_j}, \mathbf{y_j}),
\end{equation}

where $w_t$ is the weight given to vector \textit{i}, $\mathbf{x_i}$, $\mathbf{y_i}$ are the resource or consumer sets of the two taxa and $\mathbf{x_j}$ and $\mathbf{y_j}$ are the vectors for the taxonomy of two taxa. When $w_t$ = 0 only resource or consumer sets are used to compute similarity, while $w_t$ = 1 solely uses taxonomy.

  % \\REVIEW: In the algorithm paragraph I do not discuss the following parameters, but should I? Right now they are in Figure \ref{fig:decision_diag} though.
  % \\REVIEW: Minimum weight: minimum weight for candidate taxa to make it to predictions
  % \\REVIEW: Minimum threshold: arbitrary value set to 0.3 (no scientific basis) for similarities. If under, KNN taxa are not retained as potential candidates and their weight is not added to the candidate taxa list. It seems trivial, technically if their similarity is so low it shouldn't interfere with results? It does in cases like the atlantic cod, which has over 600 listed resources. In that case, the iterative process goes through them all and a species with a similarity = 0.05 could end up adding a total of 30 to it's weight in the candidate list. We had two choice to deal with this issue. Either we set a variable MW that varies as a function of the number of candidate resources, or we set another minimum threshold for resource to make it into the candidate list, effectively resulting in two arbitrarily chosen values for the predictions.
  % \\REVIEW: Cannibalism not allowed in this iteration of the algorithm, but it is present in empirical webs. Should be added at some point.
  % \\IDEA: Present an example that goes through the algorithm logical steps

The XXX algorithm is built on a series of logical steps that ultimately predicts a candidate resources list $C_R$ for each taxon in \textit{S1} (Figure \ref{fig:decision_diag}). For all consumer taxa $T_C$ in \textit{S1}, the algorithm first verify whether it has empirical resources $T_R$ listed in the catalogue. When it does, if $T_R$ are also in \textit{S1}, they are added as predicted resources for $T_C$. This corresponds to what we refer to as the catalogue contribution to resource predictions. Two taxa in \textit{S1} that are known to interact through the catalogue are automatically assumed to interact in \textit{S1}.

Otherwise, the algorithm passes to what we refer to as the predictive contribution to resource predictions, with candidate resources for $T_C$ identified with the KNN algorithm. If $T_R$ are also in \textit{S1}, K most similar resource $T_R'$ are identified in \textit{S1} to add to $C_R$. Then for all $T_C$ in \textit{S1}, the algorithm identifies K most similar consumer $T_C'$ in \textit{S0} and extracts their resource sets. As before, if those resources are found in \textit{S1} they are added to $C_R$, otherwise K most similar resources $T_R'$ are identified in \textit{S1} to add to $C_R$. Other parameters are used in the algorithm, but not presented here for the sake of message clarity. A more comprehensive mathematical description of the algorithm and the parameters used is however available through Figure \ref{fig:decision_diag} and the complete R code and data used for the algorithm is available at \href{https://github.com/david-beauchesne/Predict_interactions}{https://github.com/david-beauchesne/Predict\_interactions}.

\subsection{Algorithm prediction accuracy}
We used the most extensive and taxonomically detailed datasets included in the catalogue (\textbf{ref}) to assess the prediction accuracy of the algorithm. Testing accuracy of a particular dataset was done by first removing from the catalogue all pairwise interacting originating from that dataset. Accuracy was evaluated using three different statistics:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item $Score_y$ is the fraction of interactions correctly predicted:
     \begin{equation}
         Score_y = \frac{a}{a + c}
     \end{equation}

 \item $Score_{\neg y}$ is the fraction of non-interactions correctly predicted:
     \begin{equation}
       Score_{\neg y}  = \frac{d}{b + d}
     \end{equation}

 \item TSS, The True Skilled Statistics (TSS) evaluated prediction success by considering both true and false predictions, returning a value ranging from 1 (prefect predictions) to -1 (inverted predictions; \textbf{ref}): %Allouche, Tsoar et Kadmon 2006; Gravel et al. 2013
     \begin{equation}
       TSS = \frac{(ad - bc)}{(a + c)(b + d)}
     \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

where a is the number of links predicted (1) and observed (1), b is the number predicted (1) but not observed (0), c is the number predicted absent (0) but observed (1) and d is the number of predicted absent (0) and observed absent (0). These three statistics give a different perspective on prediction accuracy, focusing in turn on true interactions and non-interactions, and on both true and false predictions.

We evaluated the three statistics for the complete algorithm and for the catalogue and the predictions individually to evaluate their respective contribution to the algorithm predictive accuracy. Multiple $w_t$ values were also tested to evaluate whether taxa similarity measured as a function of resource/consumer sets or taxonomy contributed more significantly towards increased predictive accuracy. The same was done with multiple $K$ values.

Finally, we evaluated the influence of the comprehensiveness of the catalogue on prediction accuracy. We selected the arctic food web from Kortsch et al. (2015). This food web was selected as it is highly detailed taxonomically and because empirical data remains available for most of its taxa after its exclusion from the catalogue. We iteratively and randomly ($n$ = 50) removed a percentage of empirical data describing the food web taxa from the catalogue before generating new predictions with the algorithm. We also tested $w_t$ values of 0.5 and 1 to evaluate whether taxonomic similarity could support predictive accuracy in cases when empirical data for species in \textit{S1} in the catalogue is unavailable.

% \\TODO: Not MW, MT and accuracy score. The goal of the paper is to present the methodology and it just takes away from my main message. Accuracy score is taken out mainly because as non-interations vastly outnumber interactions, that graph essentially gives the same information as the score -y one. So now we would have three statistics instead of 4. Makes more sense I believe.

\section{Results}
    \subsection{Biotic interaction catalogue}
The data compilation process allowed us to build an interaction catalogue composed of 276708 pairwise interactions (interactions = 72110; non-interactions = 204598). A total of 9712 taxa (Superfamily = 15; Family = 591; Subfamily = 29; Tribe = 8; Genus = 1972; Species = 7097) are included in the catalogue, 4159 of which have data as consumers and 4375 as resources.

    \subsection{Algorithm predictive accuracy}
The overall predictive accuracy of the algorithm ranges between 80\% to almost 100\% in certain cases (Figure \ref{fig:multi_param}), except for one food web (\textit{i.e.} \textbf{ref}). Both interactions and non-interactions are well predicted by the algorithm. TSS scores are lower than $Score_y$ and $Score_{\neg y}$ due to misclassified interactions and non-interactions. This can also be observed through the effect of varying $K$ values, which increases the number of potential candidate resources for each taxa in the predictive portion of the algorithm. Prediction accuracy increases for interactions, while it decreases for non-interactions, as $K$ values increase. This means that non-interactions are misclassified as interactions in the process of increasing $Score_y$, consequently decreasing $Score_{\neg y}$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth, height=12cm]{multiple_parameters2.pdf}
  \caption{The graph presents the three statistics as a function of trait weight, which varies between 0 and 1. A weight of 0 means that similarity is measured only using set of resources for each taxa, while a weight equal to 1 means that similarity is based solely on taxonomy. We present 6 food webs with over 50 taxa each and the Barnes et al. (2008) dataset.}
  \label{fig:multi_param}
\end{figure}

Similarity being predominantly measured with resource/consumer sets ($w_t$ closer to 0) yielded better predictions than when measured with taxonomy ($w_t$ closer to 1; Figure \ref{fig:multi_param}). Resource/consumer sets therefore appears to serve as a better predictor of similarity between taxa for interactions predictions. It is nonetheless interesting to note that although the predictive contribution of the algorithm decreases as $w_t$ increases, an increased mean and decreased variability values for the TSS and $Score_y$ statistics is also observed (Figure \ref{fig:multi_param})). This suggests that while using taxonomy for similarity measurements yields lower predictive accuracy, it may also complement the catalogue contribution by predicting interactions not captured through empirical data, effectively increasing the predictive accuracy of the complete algorithm.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{catalog_predictions2.pdf}
  \caption{Graph presenting predictive accuracy as a function of the amount of information available in the catalogue. The arctic food web from Kortsch et al. (2015) was used for this, as it is highly detailed and because almost all taxa found in it had information in the catalogue even when not included in the catalogue. A random percentage of taxa in the web was iteratively removed from the catalogue (n = 50) before predicting interactions with the XXX algorithm.}
  \label{fig:catalog_pred}
\end{figure}

The partitioning of the catalogue and predictive portions of the algorithm shows that it is dependent on the comprehensiveness of the catalogue for high prediction accuracy (Figures \ref{fig:multi_param}, \ref{fig:catalog_pred}). As the amount of empirical data available in the catalogue decreases so does the overall accuracy of the algorithm (Figures \ref{fig:catalog_pred}). The predictive contribution of the algorithm however slows down the decrease in the prediction efficiency of the algorithm. Prediction accuracy still remains around 75\% with only 40\% of \textit{S1} taxa found in the catalogue (Figures \ref{fig:catalog_pred}). Furthermore, the use of taxonomy for similarity measurements is more efficient as empirical data becomes scarcer and no different than resource/consumer sets for the complete algorithm when ample data is available (Figures \ref{fig:catalog_pred}).

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Algorithm accuracy}
\subsubsection{Misclassified non-interactions}
Interactions vs non-interactions, misclassified non-interactions: real? Could be that non-interactions are not actually observed. Can we really trust $Score_{\neg y}$ then?

The algorithm could simply perform poorly in predicting non-interactions, classifying them instead as interactions. The original empirical food webs could also be the ones doing poorly at observing non-interactions. Indeed, we assumed that non-interactions in empirical food webs meant that there were no interactions between taxa. However, most of the empirical webs had a strong focus attributed to higher order consumer species and very little attention given to other taxa (\textit{e.g.} benthic invertebrates). The catalogue of interactions, on the other hand, has a much broader focus than the original empirical webs. It therefore very well may be that wrongly classified non-interactions could indeed be real but unobserved interactions in natural systems.

Furthermore, the algorithm is currently coded to ignore non-interactions in the similarity measurements. Maybe it would make sense to do the same in the interpretation of the results itself. Or a third vector to the similarity measurements could be added that considers non-interactions as a set of resources not consumed by consumers (which we have in the data). While this could make sense, more thought needs to be given to non-interactions stemming from empirical food webs and their actual value as observed data. If we think them valuable, then extra logical steps could be added to the algorithm to decrease probabilities of taxa being proposed as candidate resources by the KNN algorithm when they were observed to not interact in food webs.

\subsubsection{Usefulness of taxonomy in topology prediction}

 Interestingly, as the proportion of \textit{S1} taxa in the catalogue decreases, the similarity measured with taxonomy only performs better, with predictions performed with $w_t$ = 1 surpassing those made with $w_t$ = 0.5 as percent of taxa removed from catalogue increases. Taxonomy could thus be highly useful in data poor environments that also lack data in the catalogue.

While taxonomy plays a significant role in influencing food web structure (Eklof et Stouffer 2015), it does not account for certain traits such as body size. Even though we advocate for as simple an approach as possible, we believe that in cases where the comprehensiveness of the catalogue does not encompass a significant portion of S1, traits could be added as a third set in the similarity measurement.

% According to Eklof and Stouffer (2015), the phylogenetic component of food webs is a significant factor influencing the intervality of food webs. However, certain traits are not accounted by phylogenetic constraints, such as body size.

% We selected a list of species forming the known biodiversity of the estuary and gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada. The species list available on CaRMS (ref) for this region was selected, and completed with a comprehensive list of marine birds (Allard et al. 2013) and marine mammals (Lesage, personnal communication), for a total of 1469 species.
% The data compilation process yielded a total of 276708 binary interactions (interactions = 72110; non-interactions = 204598) for 9712 taxa (Superfamily = 15; Family = 591; Subfamily = 29; Tribe = 8; Genus = 1972; Species = 7097). Of that number, interactions for St. Lawrence taxa were described for 33\% of species, 64\% of genera and 82\% of families, although these interactions are not necessarily between two taxa found in the St. Lawrence.
