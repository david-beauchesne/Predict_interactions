Parameters:
  Kc                    Integer, how many consumer neighbors to select
  Kr                    Integer, how many resource neighbors to select
  S0                    Interction catalogue w/ 'taxa', 'taxonomy', 'resource set', 'non-resource set', 'consumer set', 'non-consumer set'
  S1                    Set of taxa for which we wish to predict pairwise interactions
  MW                    Mimimum weight to accept a candidate as a prey
  Minimum_threshold     Minimum similarity threshold used to accept candidate species. Arbitrary at this point.

Output
  A matrix 'predictions' with columns
    1. S1 taxa
    2. empirical resource of S1 taxa
    3. predicted resources of S1 taxa
